  <section>
    <p>Thank you for choosing <strong>Codiq</strong>, a mobile learning app designed to teach children aged 6–13 how to code through fun, interactive play. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information within the app, ensuring transparency, safety, and compliance with privacy standards such as COPPA and GDPR-K.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Codiq is designed with privacy in mind. We do <strong>not collect personal data</strong> such as names, emails, or contact information directly from children. The app may collect limited, non-personal data to enhance performance, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and OS version</li>
      <li>App usage statistics (levels completed, time spent)</li>
      <li>Anonymous analytics data (if enabled)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If ads are displayed, our advertising partners may collect anonymous identifiers (like Advertising ID) to deliver relevant, child-safe ads and measure performance.</p>

    <h2>2. Data from Parents or Testers</h2>
    <p>If parents, educators, or testers voluntarily share information via forms (e.g., beta testing or feedback), it is used solely for communication and improvement purposes. We never sell or share this data with third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use collected data to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve gameplay and educational quality</li>
      <li>Fix bugs and optimize performance</li>
      <li>Display appropriate, child-friendly ads</li>
      <li>Analyze usage trends (anonymously)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
    <p>Codiq may display <strong>child-appropriate ads</strong> in accordance with Google Play’s Families Policy and COPPA. We ensure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>No personalized or targeted ads to children</li>
      <li>All ads are reviewed for suitability</li>
      <li>Partners comply with children’s privacy laws</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We take data security seriously. All stored information is protected using industry-standard security practices. We never publish or disclose data publicly.</p>

    <h2>6. Parental Consent and Control</h2>
    <p>Parents and guardians are encouraged to supervise their child’s use of Codiq. We do not knowingly collect any personal data from children. If you believe a child has shared personal data, please contact us immediately for removal.</p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Codiq may use trusted third-party SDKs for analytics and ads, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">Google AdMob</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Analytics</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to request data deletion, access to collected data, or to withdraw consent for analytics and advertising. To make a request, please contact us using the information below.</p>

    <h2>9. Updates to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. Any updates will be reflected here, with the date of revision shown above. Continued use of the app means you accept these changes.</p>
